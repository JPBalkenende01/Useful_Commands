Step 1: Identify the Root Switch
Connect to a switch in your network.

Execute the following command:
Switch# show spanning-tree

Look for the section labeled Root ID. If the current switch is the root, the output will explicitly state:
This switch is the root.

If it is not the root, the Root ID section will display the Bridge ID of the current root switch, including its MAC address and priority.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2: Change the Root Switch

To make another switch the root switch, adjust the priority value for STP. By default, the switch with the lowest priority becomes the root switch.

On the switch you want to set as the root, enter global configuration mode:

Switch# configure terminal

Change the priority for the VLAN(s) in which you want this switch to be the root:

For a specific VLAN (e.g., VLAN 1):

Switch(config)# spanning-tree vlan 1 priority 4096
Lower numbers have higher priority (valid values: 0â€“61440 in increments of 4096).

To set the switch as the root for all VLANs:
Switch(config)# spanning-tree vlan 1-4094 root primary

Verify that this switch is now the root:
Switch# show spanning-tree

Switch# write memory

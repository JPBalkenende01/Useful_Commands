OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is a dynamic routing protocol that connects routers in a network.

Basic OSPF Configuration:


Router(config)# router ospf 1
Router(config-router)# network 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
Router(config-router)# network 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255 area 0

Important:

Ensure that the wildcard mask matches your subnet.

Area 0 is the backbone of OSPF.

Backup Script with rsync and crontab

Explanation: This script makes a backup of a folder to an external location with rsync. You can run this periodically via a cronjob.

Script:

#!/bin/bash
SOURCE_DIR="/path/to/source"
DEST_DIR="/path/to/destination"
LOG_FILE="/var/log/backup.log"

rsync -av --delete "$SOURCE_DIR" "$DEST_DIR" >> "$LOG_FILE" 2>&1

Implementation:
Make script executable:

chmod +x backup.sh

Add to crontab:
Open crontab with crontab -e and add:

0 2 * * * /path/to/backup.sh
This runs the backup every night at 2:00 AM.


Note:
Adjust SOURCE_DIR and DEST_DIR to your environment.

Make sure the user has sufficient rights on both directories.

Check the log file regularly.
